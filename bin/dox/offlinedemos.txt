The offline Tundra demos are scenes which do not require Tundra to be run in a server-client architecture (though nothing stops you from doing that). The shortcuts in this folder open various Tundra scenes in an offline manner. Here, Tundra is used as a "scene document editor", just like e.g. Office is when editing .doc files.

The Tundra demo files are read-only. This means that you cannot add new content to them, or replace them (this is due to Windows UAC protecting the data files in the Program Files folder, which is generally a good idea). Therefore, to start building a scene that is based on one of the demo scenes, browse to where you installed Tundra to (e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Tundra 2.2.0\scenes\) and make a copy of the sample scene folder to wherever you want to store your project to.
