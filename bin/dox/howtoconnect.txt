To connect to a Tundra scene hosted on a server, you will need to provide login information for the server. This can be done by using one of the two provided UI frontends, or from the command line.

The UI-less Viewer is a GUI which does not provide any extra UIs (apart from what is provided by the scene you log in to). It shows up a minimal login UI to query connection options.

The Browser Viewer is a GUI which decorates Tundra to behave similar to a web browser.

To start either version, find the shortcuts in the start menu.

To connect to a Tundra server from the command line without showing up a GUI, use the syntax

tundra --connect <serverAddress>;<serverPort>;<tcp|udp>;<username>[;<password>]

This will require tundra.exe to reside in your system PATH. Alternatively, you can specify the full path to Tundra executable.
